=head1 NAME

Net::Kestrel - Kestrel Client for Perl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Kestrel;

    my $queuename = 'myqueue';

    my $kes = Net::Kestrel->new; # defaults to host => 127.0.0.1, port => 2222
    $kes->put($queuename, 'foobar');
    # ... later

    # take a peek, doesn't remove the item
    my $item = $kes->peek($queuename);

    # get the item out, beginning a transaction
    my $real_item = $kes->get($queuename);
    # ... do something with it

    # then confirm we finished it so kestrel can discard it
    $kes->confirm($queuename, 1); # since we got one item

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Kestrel is a B<text protocol> client for L<https://github.com/robey/kestrel>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 debug

=head2 host

The ip address of the Kestrel host you want to connect to.

=head2 port

The port to connect to.  Defaults to 2222.

=head2 timeout

The timeout value for operations.  Defaults to 3 seconds.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 confirm ($queuename, $count)

Confirms $count items from the queue.

=head2 delete ($queuename)

Delete the specified queue.

=head2 flush ($queuename)

Flush (empty) the specified queue.

=head2 get ($queuename, $timeout_in_millis)

Gets an item from the queue.  Note that this implicitly begins a transaction
and the item must be C<confirm>ed or kestrel will give the item to another
client when you disconnect.  Optionally you may provide a timeout (in
milliseconds).  Net::Kestrel will block for that long waiting for a value in
the queue.

=head2 peek ($queuename, $timeout_in_millis)

Peeks into the specified queue and "peeks" at the next item.  Optionally you
may provide a timeout (in milliseconds).  Net::Kestrel will block for that
long waiting for a value in the queue.

=head2 put ($queuename, $string)

Puts the provided payload into the specified queue.

=head2 stats

Returns stats from the kestrel instance

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Incomplete

B<This module is brand new and is likely missing features.>

=head2 Protocol

Net::Kestrel speaks Kestrel's text protocol only at present.

=head2 Error Handling

Kestrel returns errors in the form of:

  -Error string

When any command returns a string like this, Net::Kestrel will die with that
message.  Therefore you should C<eval> any methods you care to deal with
errors for.
